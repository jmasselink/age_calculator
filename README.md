Jupyter Lab notebooks and maybe some Excel datetime wrangling
>I basically want to figure out when I'll be 50% as old as my Dad so that we can celebrate that day. I believe it will be coming up soon.
This is a little program that I'm building to determine when that day is!

Assuming you have Python 3.x, install 'virtualenv' using pip.
> pip install virtualenv

Clone this repo.
> git clone https://github.com/jmasselink/age_calculator.git

Create a Python virtual environment called 'age_calculator' where you store your venvs.
 - in Windows, using command line:
>  C:\Python35>python -m virtualenv C:\venv\

Navigate to C:\venv\age_calculator and activate the environment
> cd C:\venv\age_calculator>Scripts\activate

> (age_calculator) C:\venv\age_calculator\Scripts> pip install -r [PATH]/requirements.txt

Navigate to the git repository which contains notebooks:
> (age_calculator) C:\venv\age_calculator\Scripts>cd C:\code\age_calculator\notebooks

Launch jupyter lab
> (age_calculator) C:\code\age_calculator\notebooks> jupyter lab
